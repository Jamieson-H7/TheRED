## What is this website?
This website is for The Ruby E-Institute of Dreams (TheRED), in which users can view and upload courses in order to further their own educational endeavors. We offer:
- A markdown editor that supports a wide variety of features that markdown offers, such as code blocks with syntax highlighting and hyperlinking.
- A course selection browsing screen to peruse content at your will.
- A hype homepage :D

All in all, if you want to use this website, then this is the website for you!
## Why does this exist?
The reason why this website exists is for our Computer Science Capstone project. We chose this over making a custom programming language which would have also been hype but we weren't sure if that was enough. Regardless, I think developing this website with my project partner was awesome all things considered.
## What will happen to this in the future?
Expect everything you love and hold dear to break upon completion of the school year... please do not seriously expect this to be maintained after June 2024, so enjoy the website while it is still up and not yet sunsetted.
